# Description

As you can plainly see just from looking it is not hard to tell that this portfolio still needs a lot of work styling-wise since I wanted to make styling about 70% of it. And yes I am fully aware that it probably took you ages to navigate it, but that is only because this is all the beginning! My intent is to style it in a manner similar to a universe that is very close to my heart; Warhammer 40k. Ever since I got started in programming a few months ago I could not get it out of my mind how much this made me think of the Tech-Priests of the 40k universe. Theirs is a faith dedicated to a deity known as the Machine God. Thus, with 40k being a major part of my life as a whole from books to games to even a couple movies, I could not help but try to reproduce the same gothic asthetic that I see in other media. Problem is, I am still very much a novice when it comes to these design aspects, but I have high hopes that given time enough to process and learn new ways of integrating these technologies, I will have this portfolio looking slick and awesome. All I need is time and the motivation to do it!

# Future-Development

There is a lot that I still have planned to do, and this is only for the text that appears on the screan for the most part. The only thing holding me back right now is lack of time.

- [Holographic projector](https://codepen.io/johnlouie04/pen/NeJBwO) by: [John Louie Bi√±as](https://codepen.io/johnlouie04), ignore the floating pistol... the idea is to have the projector at the bottom of the screan to give it a more projected effect for what is on screen
- [Snap SVG](http://snapsvg.io/) animations for the smaller text
- [Glitch Effect](https://ihatetomatoes.net/how-to-create-css-glitch-effect/) by: [Petr Ticky](https://ihatetomatoes.net/the-best-of/), animations for the larger text
- [Typing Carousel](https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/jkivt) by: [Gregory Schier](https://codepen.io/gschier), for introduction text on app load
- [Typed.css](https://codepen.io/brandonmcconnell/pen/bZqGdw) by: [Brandon McConnell](https://codepen.io/brandonmcconnell) for contact page text
- [Luminance](https://codepen.io/onecastell/pen/VwZWBvr) by: [Franklin Castellanos](https://codepen.io/onecastell) for all text to give off a better glowing effect
